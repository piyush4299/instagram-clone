Just start with npm install and then npm start and you will be ready to go.
Env file also pushed so I don't think it will be point of working for credential as it's for storing name of localStorage key.

Assumptions:
1. You can like or unlike the post and comments.
2. And by default there is only single user through which this action will be performed.
3. For now the data storing and updating part is taken care via localStorage due to time constraint.
4. Follow option is not done in this but timestamp conversion and number of followers,posts, following conversions into suitable format is done.
5. Reply to comment part is considered while designing data but won't be able to implement it for now due to time constraint. But can have a look at schema where it would be more clear on how I thought of proceeding with data.
6. Responsiveness is not considered here. 
7. You can add comments by default username and like them as well.
